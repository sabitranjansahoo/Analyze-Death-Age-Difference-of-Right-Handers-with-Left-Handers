# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers

**Project Description:**
This project explores the intriguing correlation between hand preference (left-handedness or right-handedness) and lifespan, aiming to validate or debunk the assertion that left-handed individuals have a shorter lifespan. The study leverages Bayesian statistics and data visualization techniques to dissect the relationship, shedding light on the influence of age and societal norms. The project's significance lies in its potential to inform tailored healthcare solutions for MedTourEasy, enhancing customer satisfaction and global competitiveness.

**Data Collection:**
The investigation relies on a dataset obtained from a 1986 National Geographic survey, encompassing over a million respondents. This dataset provides critical information such as age, gender, hand preference, and age at death. It captures the evolving rates of left-handedness across age cohorts, reflecting changing societal norms.

**Bayesian Analysis:**
The analysis employs Bayesian statistics to compute posterior probabilities, offering insights into the likelihood of being left-handed or right-handed based on the age at death. This framework integrates empirical survey data with carefully crafted prior probabilities, yielding nuanced results that explore the intricate relationship between hand preference and age.

**Age Disparity Calculation:**
Utilizing the derived posterior probabilities, the study calculates the divergence in average ages at death between left-handed and right-handed cohorts. This calculation aims to validate or refute the notion of a lifespan disparity between the two groups.

**Interactive Visualizations:**
Compelling visualizations are generated to illustrate the findings effectively. These visual representations offer a comprehensive view of the datasets, enriching the analysis and reinforcing the conclusions drawn from the Bayesian analysis.

**Findings:**
The investigation reveals that the calculated average age gap between left-handed and right-handed individuals is 5.55 years, contrary to the 9-year distinction reported in previous studies. This variance is attributed to evolving left-handedness rates over time, challenging the assumption of premature mortality for left-handers. The analysis underscores the role of shifting societal norms and their impact on hand preference distribution.

**Limitations and Future Work:**
Several approximations within the analysis, including the death distribution data and extrapolation of left-handedness rates, could introduce accuracy variance. Future work could involve random sampling techniques to assess the estimate's variability in age gaps. Additionally, exploring trends in left-handedness rates beyond the study's timeframe could offer deeper insights into the phenomenon's dynamics.

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates the power of data-driven methodologies and Bayesian analysis in unraveling complex correlations. By navigating a landscape of statistical techniques and leveraging expansive datasets, the study offers nuanced insights into the interplay between human characteristics, aging, and societal norms. The findings provide a foundation for tailored healthcare solutions and contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between hand preference and lifespan.
